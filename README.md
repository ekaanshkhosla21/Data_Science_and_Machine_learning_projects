# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a curated collection of small-scale Data Science and Machine Learning projects. These projects span across domains like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Time-Series Forecasting, and Transfer Learning. Each project is organized into its own folder with code, datasets (if applicable), and Jupyter Notebooks for ease of understanding and execution.
